		<h2>Becoming a sponsor</h2>

		<p>Are you one of the developers that submit over 15.000 scripts per week to <a href="about">3v4l.org</a>? You can become a <i>private sponsor</i>; for <b>&euro; 25</b> I will add your name or Twitter handle to the list of sponsors for a whole year.</p>
		<p>If you use this site professionally you can also become a <i>corporate sponsor</i>; for <b>&euro; 250</b> I will list your company URL for a whole year. Contact me and I might also be able to relax some of the rate-limiting restrictions.</p>
		<p>This site is visited by ~<b>40 thousand</b> unique IP addresses monthly, generating ~<b>2.5 million</b> hits. It would be awesome if we can get 2 corporate or 20 private sponsors since that would mean I no longer have to pay for the servers myself.</p>

		<p>By becoming a sponsor you are helping me pay for the servers and build features for this site. I might also spend some of the money on some whisky or cigars ;)</p>

		<p>Did I convince you? While I prefer crypto-currency for its cheap and reliable processing I also accept <a href="">Paypal</a>, and IBAN (contact me). Send me an email at <a href="mailto:root@3v4l.org">root@3v4l.org</a> after sending to have your name listed!</p>
